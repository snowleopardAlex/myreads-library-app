This project had been built for Udacity Nanodegree. 

It is composed of page: MyReads
MyReads displays 3 shelves where books can be found. The control is tied to each book and when you click it, you see dropdown window and you can move the book to a different shelf: Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read, None. 

It is composed of page: SearchPage
There is a search input, you type into it and the associated books with the query are displayed on the screen. The control is attached to each book, you click the dropdown and you can move the book to a shelf you want. The book appears on MyReads page - in the shelf of your choice.

The App works with BooksAPI backend from Udacity that is included in the project.
